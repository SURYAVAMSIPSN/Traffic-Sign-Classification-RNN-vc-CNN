# Traffic-Sign-Classification-RNN-vs-CNN
A comparative study on the performance of RNN and CNN on a dataset containing 43 different traffic signs

This is slightly different from the other repository on traffic sign classification. 


Please note: The folders Train, Test and Meta can be obtained from the German Traffic sign dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)
Please download them and then run the two python scripts. 

Also, make sure the folders are in the same folder as the scripts!!
