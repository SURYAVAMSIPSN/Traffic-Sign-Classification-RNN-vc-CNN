The evaluator can find the following files: 
1. Convolution_Neural_Network_Traffic_Sign.py
2. RNN_Traffic_Sign.py
3. A Test Folder
4. A Train Folder
5. A Meta Folder 
6. A PPT file
7. A PDF containing the final report
8. This read me file. 

Each .py file contains the code for running the CNN and RNN on the given Traffic sign 
dataset which can be found in the Train and the Test folders. 

PLEASE NOTE!!!!
Make sure that the .py files are run in this folder only and not from anywhere else. 

The codes will access the images present in the Train and Test folders for training
and testing, and to give the accuracy scores and other performance measures.
